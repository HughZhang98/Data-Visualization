      <p><b>In summary</b>, from these data, people have a lot of demand for coffee, and the average coffee drinker has to drink <b>2 cups</b> of coffee a day per person. And in the <b>IT world</b>, the number of <b>male</b> drinking coffee is not only more than female, but also <b>drink more cups of coffee than female</b>, I think it may be the reason that the number of male programmers, and the <b>pressure</b> of male programmers to be more. The Coding time and cups for genders table and the coding hours table also show that male work long hours.</p>
